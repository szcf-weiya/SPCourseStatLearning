# Notes 

In 9.3 Feature Expansion and the SVM(the 15th slide), it said the inner-products needed for d dimensional polynomials-$\binom{p+d}{d}$ basis functions.

This conclusion can be found in Multinomial Theorm(the wiki pdf).$\#_{n,m}$ is the number of monomials of degree $n$ on the variables $x_1,\ldots, x_m$(that means $(x_1+\ldots+x_m)^n$)
$$
\#_{n,m}=\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}
$$

And this proof can be found in "Stars and bars (comninatorics)"(the wiki pdf).
